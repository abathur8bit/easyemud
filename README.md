EasyeMUD is an engine with a focus on making it easy to create content.

Inspired by [The Majic Realm](https://www.facebook.com/groups/868161636530458), and [open source][repo].

A new MUD engine being written in **Java**, and using **Lua** as the scripting language. Java is easy to role code in, write unit tests for, and is easy to debug locally *and* remotely.

[Lua] (pronounced LOO-ah) is an efficient, lightweight, embeddable scripting language. It supports procedural programming, object-oriented programming, functional programming, data-driven programming, and data description.
